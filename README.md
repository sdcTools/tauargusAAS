Tau Argus As A Service

## Experimental
Interface to tau-argus such that it can be used "as a service".

Engine to calculate/apply SDC methods will be the same as for the stand-alone version, only the interface will be adjusted to facilitate the option to run tau-argus as a service.

For the time being, tau-argus can already be run as a "sort of service" using the batch-facility of tau-argus.

Development for the moment mainly by Eurostat.
